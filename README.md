# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-for-Beginners

## Content of the exercises
In technical interviews, you will be expected to code up an efficient algorithm, talk comfortably about the design, analysis and tradeoffs of a specific algorithm. Being able to succinctly perform these tasks in a timely fashion and communicate your ideas in a coherent manner is what can make the difference in thousands of dollars of compensation.

### Exercise 1
#### Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
<br>
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
<br>
<br>
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
<br>Return k.
